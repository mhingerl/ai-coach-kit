# Changelog

## 2026-10-31

- The dashboard works out fitness, fatigue and form itself from the daily training load (42-day and 7-day exponentially weighted averages), instead of showing intervals.icu's numbers; intervals.icu's values appear next to them for comparison. Strength load counts toward fatigue only by default (`STRENGTH_IN_FITNESS`). The fitness data file gains a `strength_load` column, and the first sync backfills a year of daily load so the calculation starts clean.
- Setup and dashboard state the principle: the page calculates its own metrics from raw data, provider scores are not inputs, and coaching decisions come from all the data and how the athlete feels, not one dashboard number.
- Walks no longer count as endurance hours or in the intensity split. The commute benchmark counts only the climb itself (at most `COMMUTE_MAX_KM`, default 8 km).
- Check-in skill: with icuvisor, wellness requests include the `id` field so each row carries its date.

## 2026-10-30

- The dashboard has pages now: Today, Recovery, Training load, Strength, and Season and logs.
- Today: readiness worked out on the page with the check-in's own rules (HRV 7-day average against your normal range, resting heart rate, sleep, form, Body Battery and stress), not the watch maker's readiness score; today's planned sessions with a done badge and the debrief verdict; the workout's block structure for cycling, running or other endurance sports; muscles to target today on the body map; the coming days.
- Recovery: HRV with its normal band, resting heart rate with baseline, sleep, Body Battery, stress, steps and weight. Training load: fitness, fatigue and form with form zones, weekly hours by intensity, the 28-day intensity split, FTP outdoor and indoor, session debriefs, and an optional commute benchmark.
- New data files filled by the check-in's dashboard sync: wellness, fitness, activities, planned sessions and planned workout steps. Every panel shows a short note until its data arrives.
- Readiness is context, not a gate: the athlete's feel and the plan decide the session, the planned session is the default whatever the colour, and poor markers lead to an in-session checkpoint rather than a cancelled session. Hard sessions are never dropped on markers alone.
- Today's muscles are two body maps side by side: what today's strength session works, and what's been missing from the weekly targets over the last 14 or 28 days.

## 2026-10-29

- Setup now covers the whole system: devices and dashboard questions in the interview, step-by-step connections (intervals.icu via icuvisor, hosted or local; Garmin Personal API extension with a reviewed version and checksum; smart scale via a free iOS Shortcuts automation), training data as CSV files, a training dashboard built from a template, and a daily check-in skill.
- New: check-in skill template, dashboard template (muscle load body map, weekly targets, strength progression, season plan, sessions; optional left-vs-right and asymmetry modules), exercise-to-muscle catalogue (77 exercises).
- Strength sets are logged as CSV rows instead of a table in the strength log.
- Repository entry point: paste the link into Claude and it loads the kit.
- Weekly review is part of every setup: a scheduled task that reviews the training approach (adherence, load, progression, readiness patterns, what's working), suggests plan changes, writes a block review when a training phase ends, and redesigns the dashboard for the athlete as needs change.
- The daily check-in is now a readiness check-in: a green/amber/red rating from HRV (7-day trend against a normal band), resting HR, sleep, training load, Garmin Body Battery and stress, and how the athlete feels, which then decides the session.
- New: session debriefs (compliance, fade, decoupling, new bests, a verdict that drives progression), FTP management from the athlete's own performance (outdoor and indoor separately, with clear rules for when to change), and block reviews at the end of each phase. New data files: readiness, key sessions, FTP history.
- New permissions asked in the interview: whether Claude may delete future workouts it created, and whether it sets FTP itself or proposes it. icuvisor setup now covers the matching write and delete settings.
- Setting up again: a setup-export skill writes one document with all interview answers, decisions and current numbers; a new setup imports it and only asks what's missing.

## 2026-09-28

- First version: coaching instructions and a blank exercise and workout library (strength, cycling, running).
